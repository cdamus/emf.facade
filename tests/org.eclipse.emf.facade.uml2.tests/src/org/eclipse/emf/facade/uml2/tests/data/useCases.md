## Basic Facade Use Cases

These use cases cover the basic manipulation of the *façade*.
All tests are based on the UML representation of the
**J2EE Façade Model**, using the **J2EE Profile** on classes
and interfaces.

### Use case a1

Bean kind.

### Use case a2

Home interface for bean.

### Use case a3

Finder for bean.

### Use case b1

Home interface for bean.

### Use case b2

Home interface for bean.

### Use case f1

Simple models where that has a complete set of J2EE elements for
testing the *Façade Dynamic Proxy* API.

### Use case m1

A UML design model that references a J2EE model, including

* a finder for a bean in the J2EE content
* the type of a Collaboration role in the UML design model is the finder interface

### Use case m2

A UML design model that references a J2EE model, including

* a finder for a bean in the J2EE content
* the type of a Collaboration role in the UML design model is the finder interface

### Use case u1

A pure UML scenario (no profile, no façade) for verification that UML models
without façades are still sensibly processed by the façade machinery.

## Partial Façade Use Cases

These are a suite of use cases for a partial façade, covering only the opaque expressions
of the UML metamodel.

### Use case o1

A very simple model containing an opaque expression:

* a matched (language, body) pair in an opaque expression

### Use case o2

A very simple model containing an opaque expression:

* a matched (language, body) pair in an opaque expression

### Use case o3

A very simple model containing an opaque expression:

* a matched (language, body) pair in an opaque expression

### Use case o4

A very simple model containing an opaque expression:

* a matched (language, body) pair in an opaque expression
